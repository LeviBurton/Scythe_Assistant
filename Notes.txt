Design notes

think about decks vs cards with components on them.  

decks should be able to show their top card.  they should allow us to pull a card from the deck -- like the top card.
decks should allow for us to drag the top card of the deck to another deck.  decks should allow us 
to view all the cards in the deck.  

decks should be able to filter what kind of cards they are, so we can disallow certain types of cards to be added
to the deck.
